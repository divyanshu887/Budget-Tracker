Endianness is a term that describes the order in which a sequence of bytes is stored in computer memory. Endianness can be either big or small, with the adjectives referring to which value is stored first.

- Big-endian is an order in which the "big end" (most significant value in the sequence) is stored first, at the lowest storage address. 
- Little-endian is an order in which the "little end" (least significant value in the sequence) is stored first.
