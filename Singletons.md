Singletons are way to organise a bunch of global variables and static functions that sometimes may or may not act upon these variables into one kind of organized blob 
that is essentially under a single namespace. These are single instance of a class or struct and are useful when we want to apply same kind of functionality on some 
kind of global set of data.
